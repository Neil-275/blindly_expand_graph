You are an expert in natural language generation and translation from formal logic into conversational English.

## Task
Your task is to convert a given query in **logic form** into **three distinct and natural language versions** of the query. These versions must accurately capture the meaning of the logic form while sounding idiomatic and varied in their structure.

---
## Logic Form Specifications
The logic form is represented as a nested tuple string and uses the following symbols:
- **'e'**: Represents an **Entity** (a specific object, person, or place, e.g., 'Wesleyan University').
- **'r'**: Represents a **Relation** or **Predicate**.
    - If the relation starts with **"+"** or no symbol, it represents the **forward relation**.
    - If the relation starts with **"-"** (e.g., '-/people/person/place_of_birth'), the natural language query must express the **inverse of the relation**.
- **Implied Operator**: If no operator is explicitly declared between elements (e.g., two parenthesized logic statements), assume the **AND** operator (logical intersection).

---
## Input Format
The input will be a string representing the logic form, structured as a nested tuple.

**Example Input (Consistent with the defined format):**
Format: (e, (r,))
Values: ('Wesleyan University',
'+/education/educational_institution/students_graduates./education/education/major_field_of_study')

---
## Output Format
Your output must be a Python list of three strings, where each string is one of the natural language queries. Do not include any introductory or explanatory text, only the list.

**Example Output:**
["What are the major fields of study of students and graduates from Wesleyan University?",
"What did students who attended Wesleyan University major in?",
"What subjects did Wesleyan University students and graduates study as their major field?"]
